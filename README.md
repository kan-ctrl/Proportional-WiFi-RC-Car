# Proportional-WiFi-RC-Car
I modified a cheap RC car by removing the control board from the car, installing servos and motor control boards, and controlling it all with an ESP8266.
On the remote side I threw it away and will start all over again using the esp8266. In the picture you can see a temporary remote to test the car's functionality.
The result is a smoother, more controlled car. The servo allows the car to choose its turning angle. The motor control board allows the car to choose its speed, depending on the remote you design.
But the software is not complete yet because I still don't know much about the L298N mini and haven't actually made a remote other than a trial one, so this is definitely not the latest version of the code.
Equipment used for the car: esp8266,L298N mini,cheap rc car, servo,Lithium-ion batteries,bms for Lithium-ion batteries, mt3608,some wire
for the remote ,I think I'll use esp8266,ky-023,mt3608,Latch switch,Lithium-ion batteries,bms,perfboard and some wire
